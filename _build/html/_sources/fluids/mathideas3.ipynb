    "This result is called the directional derivative of $\\phi$ in the direction $\\underline{v}$. It is usually assumed that $\\underline{v}$ is a unit vector, so the result may be denoted as follows:\n",

    "The operator $\\underline{v}.\\nabla$ gives the directional derivative tangent to $\\underline{v}$. It is often called convection, meaning transport that arises due to the existence of a field (in this case a velocity field). For example, $\\underline{v}.\\nabla\\underline{v}$ is called convective acceleration.\n",

    "Suppose that a fluid particle follows the path marked in blue through the potential field $\\phi$, which is indicated by the background colour scheme and equipotential contours shown. The vectors (arrows) shown on the plot depict the instantaneous gradient field of $\\phi$. At each point on the trajectory, the experienced change in $\\phi$ is given by the projection of the particle's own direction vector $\\underline{v}$ with the gradient field, $\\nabla \\phi$, plus the instantaneous change in the potential field $\\phi$ at that point due to time evolution.\n",

    "The material derivative can also be applied to each element of a vector field $\\underline{\\phi}$, to give the change in $\\underline{\\phi}$ following the motion of a fluid particle.\n",
